# LibGuide portal template
A CSS-grids based template for a portal to link out to LibGuides

Split up into two sections, the first for general-purpose LibGuides and the second for subject-specific LibGuides

## Rich Text content
In my implementation, `content_col_1` and `content_col_3` each contain a single floating box with a Rich Text/HTML content item that serves as a header.

## LibGuide links
`content_col_2` and `content_col_4` contain floating boxes, one for each LibGuide and consisting of a single link with a custom thumbnail image.

The thumbnail images are 275 x 150 px, with some additional styling for the thumbnails and link text contained within the template itself.
